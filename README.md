Package tst is a pure Go implementation of *Ternary Search Trie*.

It's also called *Ternary Search Tree*, here's a [detailed description](http://www.drdobbs.com/database/ternary-search-trees/184410528) by the inventors Jon Bently and Robert Sedgwick.

It can be used as an efficient symbol table (as efficient as hash table), and
supports order traversal and many advanced search operations like prefix and
wildcard searches.

I've only implemented search options that I need.

Use `go get github.com/cyfdecyf/tst` to install.

Use `godoc` to see the document.
